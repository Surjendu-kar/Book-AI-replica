# BookAI Replica

## Overview
This project replicates the "Pricing" section of the TryBookAI.com website as part of a job assessment for a frontend development position. The focus of this replication was to create a component that is responsive, accessible, and maintains design fidelity with the original site. It has been developed using ReactJS, TypeScript, and Material-UI (MUI).

## Features

- ### Responsive Design:
    Ensures that the component is adaptable to   various screen  sizes from mobile to desktop. 
- ### Accessibility: 
    Uses semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to provide a better user experience for all users, including those with disabilities.
- ### Theme Toggle:
    Incorporates a light and dark mode toggle feature.
- ### Modern Technologies: 
    Built with ReactJS for component-based architecture, TypeScript for type safety, and Material-UI for styled components and responsiveness.


## Deployment

- ### ReactJS: 
    Manages the UI logic and state.
- ### TypeScript: 
    Provides type definitions to ensure more reliable coding and reduce runtime errors.
- ### Material-UI: 
    Supplies ready-made components that can be easily customized to fit the design requirements.
